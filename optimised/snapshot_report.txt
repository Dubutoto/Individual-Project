Microarchitecture Usage: 28.6% of Pipeline Slots
 | You code efficiency on this platform is too low.

    Retiring: 28.6% of Pipeline Slots
     | A high fraction of pipeline slots was utilized by useful work. While the
     | goal is to make this metric value as big as possible, a high Retiring
     | value for non-vectorized code could prompt you to consider code
     | vectorization. Vectorization enables doing more computations without
     | significantly increasing the number of instructions, thus improving the
     | performance. Note that this metric value may be highlighted due to
     | Microcode Sequencer (MS) issue, so the performance can be improved by
     | avoiding using the MS.
     |
    Front-End Bound: 10.4% of Pipeline Slots
    Bad Speculation: 0.4% of Pipeline Slots
    Back-End Bound: 60.6% of Pipeline Slots
     | A significant portion of pipeline slots are remaining empty. When
     | operations take too long in the back-end, they introduce bubbles in the
     | pipeline that ultimately cause fewer pipeline slots containing useful
     | work to be retired per cycle than the machine is capable to support. This
     | opportunity cost results in slower execution. Long-latency operations
     | like divides and memory operations can cause this, as can too many
     | operations being directed to a single execution port (for example, more
     | multiply operations arriving in the back-end per cycle than the execution
     | unit can support).
     |
        Memory Bound: 36.1% of Pipeline Slots
         | The metric value is high. This can indicate that the significant
         | fraction of execution pipeline slots could be stalled due to demand
         | memory load and stores. Use Memory Access analysis to have the metric
         | breakdown by memory hierarchy, memory bandwidth information,
         | correlation by memory objects.
         |
            L1 Bound: 26.9% of Clockticks
             | This metric shows how often machine was stalled without missing
             | the L1 data cache. The L1 cache typically has the shortest
             | latency. However, in certain cases like loads blocked on older
             | stores, a load might suffer a high latency even though it is
             | being satisfied by the L1. Note that this metric value may be
             | highlighted due to DTLB Overhead or Cycles of 1 Port Utilized
             | issues.
             |
                DTLB Overhead: 100.0% of Clockticks
                 | Issue: A significant portion of cycles is being spent
                 | handling first-level data TLB misses.
                 | 
                 | Tips:
                 | 
                 | 1.  As with ordinary data caching, focus on improving data
                 | locality and reducing the working-set size to minimize the
                 | DTLB overhead.
                 | 
                 | 2. Consider using profile-guided optimization (PGO) to
                 | collocate frequently-used data on the same page.
                 | 
                 | 3. Try using larger page sizes for large amounts of
                 | frequently-used data.
                 |
                    Load STLB Hit: 100.0% of Clockticks
                     | In significant fraction of cycles the (first level) DTLB
                     | was missed by load accesses, that later on hit in second-
                     | level TLB (STLB).
                     |
                    Load STLB Miss: 0.0% of Clockticks
                Loads Blocked by Store Forwarding: 0.0% of Clockticks
                Lock Latency: 0.0% of Clockticks
                 | A significant fraction of CPU cycles spent handling cache
                 | misses due to lock operations. Due to the microarchitecture
                 | handling of locks, they are classified as L1 Bound regardless
                 | of what memory source satisfied them. Note that this metric
                 | value may be highlighted due to Store Latency issue.
                 |
                Split Loads: 1.0% of Clockticks
                4K Aliasing: 15.0% of Clockticks
                FB Full: 100.0% of Clockticks
                 | This metric does a rough estimation of how often L1D Fill
                 | Buffer unavailability limited additional L1D miss memory
                 | access requests to proceed. The higher the metric value, the
                 | deeper the memory hierarchy level the misses are satisfied
                 | from. Often it hints on approaching bandwidth limits (to L2
                 | cache, L3 cache or external memory). Avoid adding software
                 | prefetches if indeed memory BW limited.
                 |
            L2 Bound: 0.0% of Clockticks
            L3 Bound: 5.2% of Clockticks
             | This metric shows how often CPU was stalled on L3 cache, or
             | contended with a sibling Core. Avoiding cache misses (L2
             | misses/L3 hits) improves the latency and increases performance.
             |
                L3 Latency: 0.3% of Clockticks
                 | This metric shows a fraction of cycles with demand load
                 | accesses that hit the L3 cache under unloaded scenarios
                 | (possibly L3 latency limited). Avoiding private cache misses
                 | (i.e. L2 misses/L3 hits) will improve the latency, reduce
                 | contention with sibling physical cores and increase
                 | performance. Note the value of this node may overlap with its
                 | siblings.
                 |
                SQ Full: 6.5% of Clockticks
                 | This metric measures fraction of cycles where the Super Queue
                 | (SQ) was full taking into account all request-types and both
                 | hardware SMT threads. The Super Queue is used for requests to
                 | access the L2 cache or to go out to the Uncore.
                 |
            DRAM Bound: 11.0% of Clockticks
             | This metric shows how often CPU was stalled on the main memory
             | (DRAM). Caching typically improves the latency and increases
             | performance.
             |
                Memory Bandwidth: 28.8% of Clockticks
                 | Issue: A significant fraction of cycles was stalled due to
                 | approaching bandwidth limits of the main memory (DRAM).
                 | 
                 | Tips: Improve data accesses to reduce cacheline transfers
                 | from/to memory using these possible techniques:
                 |     - Consume all bytes of each cacheline before it is
                 |       evicted (for example, reorder structure elements and
                 |       split non-hot ones).
                 |     - Merge compute-limited and bandwidth-limited loops.
                 |     - Use NUMA optimizations on a multi-socket system.
                 | 
                 | Note: software prefetches do not help a bandwidth-limited
                 | application.
                 |
                Memory Latency: 15.3% of Clockticks
                 | Issue: A significant fraction of cycles was stalled due to
                 | the latency of the main memory (DRAM).
                 | 
                 | Tips: Improve data accesses or interleave them with compute
                 | using such possible techniques as data layout re-structuring
                 | or software prefetches (through the compiler).
                 |
                    Local Memory: 0.9% of Clockticks
                    Remote Memory: 1.4% of Clockticks
                    Remote Cache: 0.3% of Clockticks
            Store Bound: 2.7% of Clockticks
                Store Latency: 17.9% of Clockticks
                Split Stores: 0.4%
                DTLB Store Overhead: 0.1% of Clockticks
                    Store STLB Hit: 0.1% of Clockticks
                    Store STLB Miss: 0.0% of Clockticks
        Core Bound: 24.5% of Pipeline Slots
         | This metric represents how much Core non-memory issues were of a
         | bottleneck. Shortage in hardware compute resources, or dependencies
         | software's instructions are both categorized under Core Bound. Hence
         | it may indicate the machine ran out of an OOO resources, certain
         | execution units are overloaded or dependencies in program's data- or
         | instruction- flow are limiting the performance (e.g. FP-chained long-
         | latency arithmetic operations).
         |
Memory Bound: 36.1% of Pipeline Slots
 | The metric value is high. This can indicate that the significant fraction of
 | execution pipeline slots could be stalled due to demand memory load and
 | stores. Use Memory Access analysis to have the metric breakdown by memory
 | hierarchy, memory bandwidth information, correlation by memory objects.
 |
    Cache Bound: 32.0% of Clockticks
     | A significant proportion of cycles are being spent on data fetches from
     | caches. Check Memory Access analysis to see if accesses to L2 or L3
     | caches are problematic and consider applying the same performance tuning
     | as you would for a cache-missing workload. This may include reducing the
     | data working set size, improving data access locality, blocking or
     | partitioning the working set to fit in the lower cache levels, or
     | exploiting hardware prefetchers. Consider using software prefetchers, but
     | note that they can interfere with normal loads, increase latency, and
     | increase pressure on the memory system. This metric includes coherence
     | penalties for shared data. Check Microarchitecture Exploration analysis
     | to see if contested accesses or data sharing are indicated as likely
     | issues.
     |
    DRAM Bound: 11.0% of Clockticks
     | The metric value is high. This indicates that a significant fraction of
     | cycles could be stalled on the main memory (DRAM) because of demand loads
     | or stores.
     |
     | The code is memory bandwidth bound, which means that there are a
     | significant fraction of cycles during which the bandwidth limits of the
     | main memory are being reached and the code could stall. Review the
     | Bandwidth Utilization Histogram to estimate the scale of the issue.
     | Improve data accesses to reduce cacheline transfers from/to memory using
     | these possible techniques: 1) consume all bytes of each cacheline before
     | it is evicted (for example, reorder structure elements and split non-hot
     | ones); 2) merge compute-limited and bandwidth-limited loops; 3) use NUMA
     | optimizations on a multi-socket system.
     |
     | The code is latency bound, which means that there are a significant
     | fraction of cycles during which the code could be stalled due to main
     | memory latency. Consider optimizing data layout or using software
     | prefetches through the compiler to improve cache reuse and to reduce the
     | data fetched from the main memory.
     |
    NUMA: % of Remote Accesses: 58.8%
     | A significant amount of DRAM loads were serviced from remote DRAM.
     | Wherever possible, try to consistently use data on the same core, or at
     | least the same package, as it was allocated on.
