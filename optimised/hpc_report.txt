         | The system spent much time heavily utilizing DRAM bandwidth. Improve
         | data accesses to reduce cacheline transfers from/to memory using
         | these possible techniques: 1) consume all bytes of each cacheline
         | before it is evicted (for example, reorder structure elements and
         | split non-hot ones); 2) merge compute-limited and bandwidth-limited
         | loops; 3) use NUMA optimizations on a multi-socket system. Note:
         | software prefetches do not help a bandwidth-limited application. Run
         | Memory Access analysis to identify data structures to be allocated in
         | High Bandwidth Memory (HBM), if available.
